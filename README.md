The application is to be written in the language Go.

#### Minimum viable product
A product able to load EDICT and KANJIDIC, and parse through its contents. 
The user should be able to use a search function to find relevant vocabulary and kanji using English or Japanese search terms. 
The program should have a simple graphical user interface.

#### Coding conventions
- Using gofmt to structure the code according to the golang standards
- Variable names should be indicative of their purpose
